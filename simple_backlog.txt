PART I - generating primes
Create array of size N
Initialise with numbers 1, 2 and 3
construct for loop stating at 5, incrementing by i+=2, until array is full
Check if each number in loop can be divided by each number in the array 
(excluding the first 2)
if not add the number to the array

PART I - optimisation
Once current number divided by current prime in array < 3, skip the rest of numbers in array
Use threading (divide array in half and give each thread half?)

PART I - tests
check no of primes generated is correct
check generated primes against a small array of primes
read n primes from text file and check they are the same


PART II - multiplicatin table
create 2d array
construct 2 nested for loops each counting from i = 0 to i < N+1
make position (0,0) blank
multiply i*j and place into position (i,j) in new array
format table (pretty print)

PART II - tests
check size of table is correct
check generated table against small multiplication table
read multiplication table of size N from txt file and check it is the same
